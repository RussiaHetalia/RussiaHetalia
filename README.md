  ***BFI***: Im weird about meeting new people. I ususally remain **mostly silent** with people I do not know unless something I am passionate about comes up. I am *not* annoyed at you being around me and my friends, I'm just a little strange. ![E4368F36-8549-4C31-ABD9-AEF1C4979C4B](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f5982ee-d1e1-4ff6-8f85-172efecf7acc)
